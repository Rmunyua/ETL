Introduction:
Point of Living is a globally recognized magazine based in the United States. The mission of Point of Living (POL) is to inspire readers in making a positive impact in their lives. One of the main events for the magazine is to publish the city rankings in terms of economic health and living conditions. 
The objective of this project is to identify the best cities to live in in the United States. 

Client Request:
POL is interested in compiling a database of United States cities, which will include most of the indicators of economic status and living conditions. By querying through the database, POL will be able to calculate the city scores in terms of “best cities to raise a family”, “ best cities to start a career”, “best cities for retirement” to provide valuable information to different customers (e.g. young professionals, real estate investors) who are willing to explore different cities.
Parameters for this demo database includes: Employment rate | Income | Rental rates | Weather
